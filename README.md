# conVisTools
A set of hobbled visualization tools that use freesurfer's desikan-killany parcellation and plot the surface rendering. Largely inspired by Thomas Yeo's surface tools - the color rendering of major regions, and inspired from the MMP HCP parcellation rendering parcels as shadings within each region.
